# Delta-Hedging Based on Black-ScholesFormula

1. Simulation
Built delta hedging strategy and tested its performance with 1000 simulated stock prices paths and option prices calculated by Black-Scholes Formular and computed and plot hedging errors and cumulative hedging errors (Profit and Loss).

2. Back test 
Back tested the validity of using Black-Scholes model as pricing method by constructing delta-hedging strategy based on real-world stock, option, and interest rate data and examined the distribution of profit and loss with hedge.
